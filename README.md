# Ödengeç!

Much better and modernised version of [iPay](https://github.com/spawnedc/iPay). For now we are using the same styling and forms.

**Prerequisities:**
* A virtual env with Python 2.7
* NPM v6.4.0 (we have a .nvmrc, so use NVM)
* [Optional] [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/#download) plugin for your editor
* Patience

### How to get up and running:
* Clone the repo (duh!)
* Create your virtual env
* Run `./install_deps`
* Run `npm i`
* Run `npm start`
* Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/)
* ...
* Profit
